# pandas-challenge
## Overview of Project
The Pandas Challenge asked to analyze school and standardized test data of a particular district to show trends in a school's performance thru the use of Pandas DataFrames.
### Purpose
The purpose of the challenge was to get used to pulling and manipulating data in the Pandas DataFrame to get a better understanding of school performance and then to use the analyzed data to make conclusions.
## Results
From the calculations, it is clear that the largest schools had significantly lower passing rates as shown below:

Another major conclusion was that Charter schools faired much better than District schools in both overall passing % and especially math scores (shown below).
